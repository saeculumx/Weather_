# Weather_
Nowadays, people rely on the weather forecast to schedule their daily work, transportation and clothing, so I decide to develop an android application which can offer the up-to-date weather information together with the suggestions to the users.  

The system must have:  
+ The ability to offer weather information to users.
+ The ability to refresh the weather information.
+ The ability to show future weather informations.
+ The ability to locate the users location using the GPS

The system should have:  
+ The ability to change background according to weather condition.
+ The ability to offer other suggestions according to the weather condition.
+ The ability to login for storing users settings.

The system could have:  
+ The ability to combine map to indicate road condition.  

The system will not have  
+ The ability to show Ads.
+ The ability to have a built-in social network.
